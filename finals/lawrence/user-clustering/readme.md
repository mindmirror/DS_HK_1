# User Clustering (GA Data Science Project)

In this project we use k-means clustering method to analyze anonymous users' browsing data and cluster them into groups. We have collected and grouped users' impressions on different channels and normalized them for k-means distance calculation. After the clustering, each user will be assigned a group ID. We then group the users by their group ID and see what are the similarities.
