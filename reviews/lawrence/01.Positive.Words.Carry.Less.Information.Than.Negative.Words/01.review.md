# Review of Positive words carry less information than negative words

## Abstract
This journal shows that the frequency of word use is not only determined by the word length and the average information content, but also by its emotional content. The authors find the words with a positive emotional content are more frequently used, which lends support to Pollyanna hypothesis that there should be a positive bias in human expression. They also find that negative words contain more information than positive words, as the informativeness of a word increases uniformly with its valence decrease. The finds support earlier conjectures about (i) the relation between word frequency and information content, and (ii) the impact of positive emotions on communication and social links.

## Style
The paper most likely interests linguists since it shows the relation between the emotion of the word and the information the word carries. 

## Methods
The authors choose 1000 to 3000 words for English, German and Spanish, and quantify the emotionality of these words using Self-Assessment Mannequin (SAM) method and choose valence as the emotion value for each word. They rescale the value to the interval [-1, 1] and then analyse Google's N-gram dataset for frequency estimation.
