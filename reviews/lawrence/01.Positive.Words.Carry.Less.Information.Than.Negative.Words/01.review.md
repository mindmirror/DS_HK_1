# Review of Positive words carry less information than negative words

## Abstract
This journal shows that the frequency of word use is not only determined by the word length and the average information content, but also by its emotional content. The authors find the words with a positive emotional content are more frequently used, which lends support to Pollyanna hypothesis that there should be a positive bias in human expression. They also find that negative words contain more information than positive words, as the informativeness of a word increases uniformly with its valence decrease. The finds support earlier conjectures about (i) the relation between word frequency and information content, and (ii) the impact of positive emotions on communication and social links.

## Style
The paper most likely interests linguists since it shows the relation between the emotion of the word and the information the word carries. 

## Methods
#### 1. Frequency of emotional words
The authors choose 1000 to 3000 words for English, German and Spanish in three controlled, independent setups. And they quantify the emotionality of these words using Self-Assessment Mannequin (SAM) method and choose valence as the emotion value for each word. They rescale the value to the interval [-1, 1] and then analyse Google's N-gram dataset for frequency estimation. Taking into account all frequencies of word usage, they find for all three languages that the median of valence shifts towards positive values. This shows that the language used on the Internet is emotionally charged at considerably higher valence (about 0.3).

#### 2. Relation between information and valence
The authors use self-information of a word as its information content metric. The self-information of a word is estimated from the word's probability of appearance, which is: **_I(w)_** = **-log****_P(w)_**. They calculated *I(w)* of each word and linked it to its valence, *v(w)*. For all 3 languages, the absolute value of Pearson's correlation coefficient is larger with in word valence and self-information than word valence and frequency. The coefficient for all three languages are between -0.3 and -0.4, which shows a negative correlation. Hence the authors deduce that words with less information content carry more positive emotions. They also performed a control analysis using alternative frequency datasets, which are from traditional written corpuses,  to account for possible anomalies in the Google dataset due to its online origin. They obtained similar but slightly lower Pearson's correlation coefficients.

## Conclusion
I think this journal well supports Pollyanna hypothesis that people tend to use positive expressions. The key to get this conclusion lies in the emotionality quantification of words. These emotional score are obtained from extensive human ratings. Once we get the emotional scores of each word, we can do some interesting analysis by using statistic tools. We can see how the emotionality are distributed, how it is correlated with other features, such as frequency.

I have some doubts about the conclusion that positive words carry less information. The information here refers to self-information, which is a function of words' probability of appearance. The relation between valence and self-information is still a relation between valence and word frequency. It also gives an example of word "violent" that in the sentence "dangerous murderers are violent" it contains less information than in "fluffy bunnies are violent". Although the probability of finding the word "violent" is larger when talking about murderers than about bunnies, I don't see that "fluffy bunnies are violent" carries more entropy than "dangerous murderers are violent".
