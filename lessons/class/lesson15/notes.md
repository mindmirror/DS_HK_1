* *Number of home runs*: Number of home runs People want to see home : People want to
see home runsâ€”home runs are exciting, and teams will pay for players who can hit
home runs
* *Batting average* (Hits/At Bats): Most common statistic when comparing players

## Narrow down the input variables

You might also want to consider variable to group by, or how some variables can be made valuable through your manipulation. The features not of interest were removed.

### Group By

    managerID, An ID for individuals who served as managers
    teamID, Team
    lgID, League

### Interesting, but problematic or more work

    hofID, An ID for individuals who are in teh baseball Hall of Fame
    bats, Player's batting hand (left, right, or both)
    birthYear, Year player was born
    birthMonth, Month player was born

### Intuitive Input Variables:

    yearID, Year
    G, Games
    AB, At Bats
    R, Runs
    H, Hits
    2B, Doubles
    3B, Triples
    HR, Homeruns
    RBI, Runs Batted In
    BB, Base on Balls
    SO, Strikeouts
    IBB, Intentional walks
    weight, Player's weight in pounds
    height, Player's height in inches

# Output Variable:

    salary, Salary

Define your array of features and response variable and load the data

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn import feature_selection, linear_model

response = ['salary']
features = ['weight', 'height', 'yearID', 'R', 'X2B', 'X3B', 'HR', 'RBI', 'SB', 'CS', 'BB', 'SO']

# Create a new dataframe
base = pd.read_csv('https://raw.github.com/ga-students/DS_HK_1/gh-pages/data/class/baseballRegressionData/baseball.csv')

```

## Investigate what type of players you're dealing with

Is it possible to filter out the pitcher who might be more vabluable for their pitching skills than hitting? E.g. you can ask for `Balls Thrown (BT) > 0` to capture all the pitchers

```python
  base[base['BT'] > 0]
```

But there's no `BT` or any other pitching statistics! You've just discovered that you're dealing with a subset of the original dataset.

To sort the players by `Batting Average` and return the 10 best seasonal performances in the history of the game!

```python
# Select numerical feature
base_reduced = base[features + response]

# Deal with NA
base_drop = base_reduced.dropna()

# Response
salary = base_drop['salary'].values

# Input
base_input = base_drop[features].values

# Run feature analysis
features_set = feature_selection.univariate_selection.f_regression(base_input, salary)
```

```python

Based on the following results we know 'yearID','HR','RBI','BB','R', and 'X2B' are significant features. We can use these four features for out model. Worth noting none of these are surprising: Home Runs, Runs Batted
In and Runs scored all are hugely important in helping a baseball club win games, thus a player with
more of these statistics seems reasonably like to earn a higher salary. Additionally, as Business
Insider show demonstrates
(http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-major-league-baseball-salaries-since-1970-2011-1)
The average salary in Major League Baseball has grown exponentially over the past 40 years as TV deals
and sponsorship agreements have driven club revenue, and athletes have gains a more prominent role
in American society.

## Average Scores

Some of the most important baseball statistics are missing! Calculate these ratios yourself, for example:

```python
from __future__ import division

base['BA'] = base['H']/base['AB']

base.sort('BA', ascending=False).head(10)
```

## Looking at Team Budgets

```python
grouped = base.groupby('teamID')['salary'].mean()
grouped.order(ascending=False)

# Sanity Check
base['salary'].describe()
grouped.plot(kind='bar', colormap='rainbow')
plt.show()

zscore = lambda x: (x - x.mean()) / x.std()

### Looking at player salary per team budget
g = base.groupby('teamID')['salary']
z = g.apply(zscore)

base['budget_z'] = z
```
If we inspect the results, we'll find that the results aren't in line with what
we expected. Some teams have relatively low bugdets (e.g. Miami Marlins) but rank
very highly in the graph. We forgot to account for the exponential growth in
budgets over time! As the Miami Marlins are a relatively new team, they didn't
compete at a time when salaries were relatively lower.

To group and plot by two variables involves `unstacking` the group

```python

grouped = base.groupby(['yearID','teamID'])['salary'].mean()
grouped.unstack().plot(colormap='rainbow')
plt.show()

zscore = lambda x: (x - x.mean()) / x.std()
g = grouped = base.groupby(['yearID','teamID'])['salary']

z = g.apply(zscore)
```

Now you are comparing a player's salary against the other players on _his team_
for _the year_ in which the salary was recorded. Awesome!
